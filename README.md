## Exercises

### 1) Navigation
Open terminal and create entry to automatically print the message below

string „hello <username> the time is <datetime>“
<username> and <datetime> should be taken from the OS

example: "hello colinsiew the date is: Do 4 Jul 2019 10:05:16 CEST"

Hint: .bash_profile will need to be edited

### 2) Terminal introduction
create a directory structure using terminal with the structure below

hello/world/example.sh

The example should be completed without navigation ie. don't "cd" into directories, directories can be created recursively

hint: useful commands - mkdir, ls, touch

### 3) Scripting
Modify the example.sh script to print out all even numbers from 1-100 when terminal is opened. This will combine the previous exercises together. The path to the script should be added to your bash_profile.
